COLOUR PALETTE
============

When creating a colour for use, it must follow this convention: 

* The primary colour choice is "colour-base" and then you can have the following extensions of that shade: 
* "colour-lightest" and "colour-light" on one side of colour-base and on the other side "colour-dark" and colour-darkest"
* You don't have to have lighter and darker shades, just if you do, only go lightest/light and dark/darkest
